# data-structures-in-go
This repo is based on [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms), implementing many popular data structures in the go programming language.
As in the original repo, each data structure has its own README with related explanation and links for further reading (maybe some youtube videos).

*The data structures implemented in this project are for learning purposes only and should not be used in production.*
